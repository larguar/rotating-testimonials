			<h3>What Other's Are Saying</h3>
			<div id="rotate"> 
				<div>“Thank you for your research and leadership. I appreciate your interest in getting us in early, yet with conservative caution. I am enjoying everything Palm Beach is offering. And, I am so much more confident and comfortable working with you than with others in the past.” <span class="author">– Robert S.</span></div> 
				<div>“As I look today my (portfolio) is $691,000.00. I am 67 years old, and it looks like I WILL be retiring from my current employer within the next year so I can pursue other ventures. Thank you. Thank you VERY much.” <span class="author">– Ted T.</span></div> 
				<div>“I have been a subscriber for about a month and a half now.  With 3 different deposits, I have put in $6,000... and I am amazed at the results. My account is now worth about $16,500. I pinch myself and ask, how long this go can on.  Your cautious approach is well received.” <span class="author">– Stan L.</span></div> 
				<div>“Teeka, thank you so much for the hard work, research, and training you have provided... Although purchased over time from Sept. until now, in dollar value, $19k turned into $34k. Yay!” <span class="author">– Linda H.</span></div>
				<div>“I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your awesome recommendations! I have been subscribed to many high end publications over the years, but you are the only one which was worth the money for a man with minor means. I bought $2000 worth of ANS with an average price of $0.23 and took some profit already 3 times totaling $23000… In addition, I have bought some (invesments) on my own and have done very well. With the profits I will pay of my credit card- and other debts and have some left for a small car and a nice vacation. You have truly changed my financial life. Thanks so much! Now a subscriber of yours for life.” <span class="author">– Lacsap K.</span></div>
